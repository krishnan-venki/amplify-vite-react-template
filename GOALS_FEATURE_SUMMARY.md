## 🎓 Implementation Notes

### **Backend Requirements**
This implementation expects the following API endpoints:

1. **GET /goals**
   - Returns array of goals for authenticated user
   - Response: `{ goals: Goal[] }`

2. **GET /insights?goal_id={goalId}**
   - Returns insights filtered by goal
   - Response: `{ insights: Insight[] }`

### **Data Relationships**
- Goals and Insights are separate tables in DynamoDB
- Insights link to goals via `goal_context.goal_id`
- Goal insights have specific insight_type values (goal_*)
- Reallocation plans embedded in insight data

### **Type Safety**
- All interfaces match backend DynamoDB schema
- Strict typing for enums and unions
- Optional fields properly marked
- No `any` types used

### **Performance Considerations**
- Goals fetched once on page load
- Insights fetched per goal on demand
- Charts render on-demand (not pre-rendered)
- Sidebar uses efficient list rendering

---

## 📝 Developer Handoff Notes

### **To Continue Development:**
1. Ensure backend API endpoints are implemented
2. Test with real goal data from DynamoDB
3. Verify chart data formats match backend responses
4. Add error boundaries for production
5. Implement goal creation/editing forms
6. Add analytics tracking for goal interactions

### **Files to Review First:**
1. `src/types/goal.ts` - Understand data model
2. `src/pages/Goals.tsx` - Main page structure
3. `src/components/goals/GoalDetailView.tsx` - Detail rendering
4. `src/components/charts/*` - Chart implementations

### **Key Patterns:**
- React hooks for data fetching
- Inline styles (transitioning to Tailwind possible)
- React Router for navigation
- Amplify Auth for authentication
- Fetch API for backend calls
