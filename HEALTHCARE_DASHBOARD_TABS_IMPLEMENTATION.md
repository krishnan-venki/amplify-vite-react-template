  - Added `HealthcareTab` type with 8 tab options
  - Added `ComingSoonTab` component
  - Added mobile detection with resize handler
  - Added tab state management
  - Restructured layout with tab navigation
  - Wrapped existing content in Medical Records tab

### State Management
```typescript
type HealthcareTab = 'medicalRecords' | 'devices' | 'medications' | 
  'appointments' | 'chronicConditions' | 'mentalHealth' | 
  'familyHealth' | 'preventiveCare';

const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(window.innerWidth < 1024);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<HealthcareTab>('medicalRecords');
```

### Layout Structure
```
HealthDashboard
├── HealthcareHeader (Hero Section)
└── Main Content Container (max-width: 1400px)
    ├── Tab Navigation (horizontal scroll)
    └── Tab Content (conditional rendering)
        ├── Medical Records Tab (existing Epic content)
        └── Coming Soon Tabs (7 capabilities)
```
