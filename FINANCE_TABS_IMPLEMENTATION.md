## Tab Descriptions

### Tax Optimization & Planning
"Year-round tax intelligence that puts more money in your pocket. Automated tax-deductible expense tracking, estimated quarterly tax calculations, tax-loss harvesting alerts, retirement contribution optimization, and end-of-year tax planning with proactive strategies."

### Bill & Subscription Optimization
"Automatic monitoring ensures you never overpay for anything. Track all recurring payments, identify unused subscriptions, find better rates for insurance/internet/phone, monitor promotional pricing expirations, and optimize payment timing for maximum savings."

### Budget Management
"Budgets that breathe with your life. AI-powered budgeting using your expense patterns, adaptive to life changes, real-time monitoring with predictive adjustments, smart reallocation suggestions, and shared household budgets with partner visibility."

### Savings & Investment Goals

## Technical Details

### Type Definitions
```typescript
type FinanceTab = 'dashboard' | 'tax' | 'bills' | 'budget' | 'savings';
```

### State Management
- `activeTab` state controls which tab content is displayed
- Default tab: `'dashboard'`
- Tab changes are instant with conditional rendering

### Layout Structure
```
FinanceHeader (Hero section)
  â†“
FilterBar (Sticky - Month selector + Action buttons)
  â†“
Capability Tabs (Sticky below FilterBar)
  â†“
Tab Content (Dashboard or ComingSoonTab)
```

### Sticky Positioning Hierarchy
1. FilterBar: `zIndex: 100`, `top: 0`
2. Tab Bar: `zIndex: 90`, `top: 88px`
3. Content scrolls normally below

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Tab bar scrolls horizontally if tabs don't fit
- Tab labels shortened on mobile (e.g., "Bill & Subscription" â†’ "Bill")
- Padding adjusted for mobile screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Color Scheme

- Hover: Darker gray (#374151) with light gray background (#f9fafb)
- Coming Soon badge: Blue background (#eff6ff) with blue text (#0369a1)

## Future Enhancements
When implementing actual capabilities:
1. Replace `ComingSoonTab` with actual component
2. Update `activeTab` condition in FinanceDashboard.tsx
3. Add any required data fetching hooks
4. Maintain consistent layout and styling
